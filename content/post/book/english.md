SCHOOL BELLS
High school students in the United States hear about twenty bells every day. The first bell is the
tardy bell. If students are not in their seats when the tardy bell rings, they know they are late.
Another bell rings at the end of each class, and everyone leaves class quickly and goes to the next
one. When students are in a difficult class, they are often happy to hear the bell ring, but if the class
is interesting, they do not want the bell to ring

THE FIRST SNOW
Helen is from Miami, a beautiful city in the state of Florida. Today Helen is not in Miami. Her father has
a new job in the state of Michigan and the family is in Detroit. Helen thinks that Detroit is a nice city, but
she is very sad - because all her friends are still in Miami
Helen spends most of the day by the window. She looks out and thinks about the warm sunshine in
Florida. She wants to go back to Miami and join her friends on the beach, but her home is in Detroit now.
As she looks out the window, Helen sees some white flakes drift slowly to the ground. Soon the sky is
full of them. It is the first time that she sees snow. The entire street begins to turn white. Helen thinks that
snow is even more beautiful than sunshine. Now she is not sad. She wants to write to her friends and tell
them - that she likes Detroit

SKY DIVING
An interesting new sport in the United States is sky diving. People who like this sport often form a club.
The members of the club get into airplanes and fly high above the clouds. When it is time, each person
jumps from the airplane and falls toward the earth at a very high speed. All of the members have
parachutes but they do not open the parachutes for a long time
From the ground they look like big birds. The sky divers say that they sometimes feel like birds also.
Some people like to swim in the ocean or to play in the snow, but the favorite place for sky divers is the sky

contoh 1 : You are a teacher
You are NOT a teacher
are you a teacher?
contoh 2 : You teach
You DO not teach

Jika kalimat tersebut TIDAK memiliki auxiliary verb seperti pada contoh 2?? ..tentu Anda harus
menambahkan sendiri Auxiliary verb nya DO ataukah DOES. Jika ada sebuah kalimat SUDAH memiliki
auxiliary verb (contoh 3), anda tidak perlu cape2 lagi dalam membuat kalimat Negative dan Interrogative

AMERICAN GRAMMAR !!
Orang Amerika menganggap bahwa HAVE, NEED, DARE adalah verb bukan Auxiliary verb. Itulah
sebabnya muncul perbedaan sedikit, amati :
British English Grammar -> You need a car
You need NOT a car
Need you a car?
American Grammar --> You need a car
You DON’T need a car
DO you need a car
Yang mana yang benar? semuanya benar. Namun di Indonesia kecenderungan Grammar nya berkiblat ke
Amerika. Contoh : developping (disekolah pasti di salahkan)

Hukum Kalimat
1.Predicate selalu Verb atau Tobe
I am a teacher (Predicate = tobe)
I teach (Predicate = verb)
2.Verb adalah kata kerja murni yang belum mendapatkan awalan atau akhiran apapun
seperti write, sing
Jika sudah mendapatkan awalan TO SING, TO WRITE
Begitupun jika sudah mendapatkan akhiran ING seperti SINGING, WRITING mereka
adalah Nouns
3.Subject, Object = NOUN
I like Sport
I like Swim (salah)
P=verb
O=noun
---> kalimat ini salah karena Object nya BUKAN noun
like swimming --. Kalimat ini benar karena objectnya sekarang adalah NOUN
like to swim
-> Kalimat ini juga benar karena objectnya NOUN

READING COMPREHENSION
Something about My Job
My name is Shiramu Rakatton. I am Thai. I come from Cambodia, but I live in Indonesia now. I moved to
Jakarta 5 years ago. I am now a manager at PT Sampoerna
About three years ago in 2007, I was an English teacher at a private school (sekolah swasta). I taught
(teach) elementary school (SD) at that time. My salary (gaji) was 1.500.000 Rp. a month. It’s not a good
salary. Because I am married already. I have 1 son and 1 daughter.
In 2008 I applied for (melamar) a new job at PT Sinar Ciomas. It was in Serang. I applied for the position
of marketing staff. I was successful. I started my career there and I got (get- mendapat) better salary
(better=lebih baik). I got 3.000.000 Rp a month.
In January 2009, I resigned (mengundurkan diri) and I moved to PT Sampoerna. I am a marketing manager
now. And of course, I earn (memperoleh) high salary every month. It’s around 15.000.000 Rp. a month. I am very happy.
