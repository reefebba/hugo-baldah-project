===========Skill + Edu
Master any skill - DiSSS Framework D - Deconstruction (+ identify) S - Selection (+ simplify) S - Sequencing (+ optimize fundamental elements) S - Stakes (+ motivation/importance/consequence) ***** Deconstruction - Focus on the basic elements! (deconstruction of the skill into individual logical mechanics, identify and focus on the basics and keep it simple for the first 5 sessions) Selection - Selecting the few most important elements, that provides the most benefit! (minimalism / Pareto principle / 20-80 principle, the 20% input that provides 80% output) Sequencing - Learn and develop the fundamental elements/skill framework! (build up the skill from important basic elements, don't just memorize and blindly follow "the best practice" for learning a skill, try tasks in another order, even "reverse engineering" the skill) Stakes - Have an incentive that keep your motivation high! (something you find very important and will strive to uphold, something with consequence/high stakes) ***** Simplify and focus! Perfection is acheived... not when there is nothing more to add... but when there is nothing more to take away.﻿

#Books
(1) Truly good books are few and far between — and so they’re priceless
The first is good content.
The second is good craft.
(2) Conversely: there’s a lot of garbage out there
(3) Reading easily becomes just another form of consumption — and procrastination
reading isn’t the secret to success.
(4) If you’re reading for growth, read to get answers on specific questions
(5) Listen to people who have actually, firsthand experienced the thing
(6) Context and timing is king
(7) Confirmation bias, the risk of influence, and the fact that no writing can be totally objective
if you’re looking for someone to make you feel validated, you can.
(8) All of this being said, reading is a personal journey

#Quotes

"Instead of trying to do everything, figure out what deserves your time and energy"

"We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done." — Alan T

"No need to reinvent the wheel when you can improve upon the past.
Its not what you know, its who you know”. 

luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.

Networking is just as important as your skillset, and my experience is proof of that
